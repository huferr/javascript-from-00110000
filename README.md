# Getting started

<h3><strong>What is Javascript?</strong></h3> 

<p>It is a high-level, lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented, just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.</p> 

<p>It has dynamic typing, prototype-based, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.</p> 

<br>

> **High-level:** Javascript is a strong abstraction from the "details" of the computer (e.g. binary code). Making this language easier to use compared to others low-level languages. Rather than dealing with *registers*, *memory addresses*, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, functions, loops, threads and other abstract concepts.
